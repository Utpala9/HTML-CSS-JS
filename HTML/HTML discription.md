# HTML (HyperText Markup Language)

## What is HTML?
HTML is the **basic building block of the web**.  
It is used to **structure content** on a webpage like text, images, buttons, links, forms, videos, etc.

HTML is **not a programming language** — it is a **markup language** that tells the browser *what content is*.

## Why do we use HTML?
We use HTML to:
- Create the **structure** of a website
- Tell the browser **what to display**
- Organize content using headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, and forms
- Connect webpages using links
- Add images, audio, video, and user inputs

👉 Without HTML, **a website cannot exist**.

## What does HTML do exactly?
HTML:
- Defines **headings** (`<h1>` to `<h6>`)
- Creates **paragraphs** (`<p>`)
- Adds **links** (`<a>`)
- Displays **images** (`<img>`)
- Builds **forms** (`<form>`, `<input>`)
- Separates layout sections (`<div>`, `<section>`, `<header>`)

It gives **meaning and structure** to content.

## How HTML works (simple)
- Browser reads HTML line by line
- Converts it into a **visual webpage**
- Works together with:
  - **CSS** → for styling
  - **JavaScript** → for behavior

**HTML = Skeleton**  
**CSS = Beauty**  
**JavaScript = Brain**
