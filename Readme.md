# 📌 Frontend Practice Project (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

## 📝 Description  
This is a **learning-in-public** frontend practice project built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
The project was created while following a **4-hour frontend tutorial**, along with hands-on practice, experimentation, and self-learning.
