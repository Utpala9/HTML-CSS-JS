# CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

## What is CSS?
CSS is used to **style and design webpages**.  
It controls how HTML elements look — colors, fonts, spacing, layout, and responsiveness.

CSS is not a programming language; it is a **styling language**.

## Why do we use CSS?
We use CSS to:
- Make websites **visually attractive**
- Separate **design from structure**
- Control layout and positioning

- Improve user experience

👉 Without CSS, websites look plain and boring.

CSS:

- Adds **animations and transitions**
- Makes websites **responsive**

## How CSS works (simple)

**CSS = Design**  
**JavaScript = Functionality**
